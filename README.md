# SwiftUi3PhotoCam

Written in SwiftUI 3, so plist file is absent (plist is accessible in project settings)

For some reason not always capture/save new image, have no idea why (not able to save in case it is not captures)

But you can hear when image is not captured - there is no "photo sound"



Photo part is based on videotutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hvaniprctk but code is not the same

VideoRecorder part is based on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GGDueorwEA
